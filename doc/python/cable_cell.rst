Cable cells
===========

.. currentmodule:: arbor

.. py:class:: cable_cell

    A cable cell is constructed from a :ref:`morphology <morph-morphology>`,
    a :ref:`label dictionary <labels-dictionary>` and a decor.

    .. note::
        The regions and locsets defined in the label dictionary are
        :ref:`thingified <labels-thingify>` when the cable cell is constructed,
        and an exception will be thrown if an invalid label expression is found.

        There are two reasons an expression might be invalid:

        1. Explicit reference to a location of cable that does not exist in the
           morphology, for example ``(branch 12)`` on a cell with 6 branches.
        2. Reference to an incorrect label: circular reference, or a label that does not exist.


    .. code-block:: Python

        import arbor

        # Construct the morphology from an SWC file.
        tree = arbor.load_swc_arbor('granule.swc')
        morph = arbor.morphology(tree)

        # Define regions using standard SWC tags
        labels = arbor.label_dict({'soma': '(tag 1)',
                                   'axon': '(tag 2)',
                                   'dend': '(join (tag 3) (tag 4))'})

        # Define decorations
        decor = arbor.decor()
        decor.paint('"dend"', 'pas')
        decor.paint('"axon"', 'hh')
        decor.paint('"soma"', 'hh')

        # Construct a cable cell.
        cell = arbor.cable_cell(morph, labels, decor)

    .. method:: __init__(morphology, labels, decorations)

        Constructor.

        :param morphology: the morphology of the cell
        :type morphology: :py:class:`morphology`
        :param labels: dictionary of labeled regions and locsets
        :type labels: :py:class:`label_dict`
        :param decorations: the decorations on the cell
        :type decorations: :py:class:`decor`

    .. method:: placed_lid_range(index)

        Returns the range of local indexes assigned to a placement in the decorations as a tuple of two integers,
        that define the range of indexes as a half open interval.

        :param index: the unique index of the placement.
        :type index: int
        :rtype: tuple(int, int)


.. py:class:: ion

    properties of an ionic species.

.. _pycablecell-probes:

Cable cell probes
-----------------

Cable cell probe addresses are defined analagously to their counterparts in
the C++ API (see :ref:`cablecell-probes` for details). Sample data recorded
by the Arbor simulation object is returned in the form of a NumPy array,
with the first column holding sample times, and subsequent columns holding
the corresponding scalar- or vector-valued sample.

Location expressions will be realised as zero or more specific sites on
a cell; probe addresses defined over location expressions will describe zero,
one, or more probes, one per site. They are evaluated in the context of
the cell on which the probe is attached.

Each of the functions described below generates an opaque :class:`probe`
object for use in the recipe :py:func:`get_probes` method.

More information on probes, probe metadata, and sampling can be found
in the documentation for the class :class:`simulation`.
